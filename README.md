To answer the question "Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?" we can look at the Mentorship Eligibility table, which shows the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program.

_Two additional queries that can provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami" are:_
The age distribution of the employees in the company
The departments and job titles with the highest number of retiring employees
These queries can provide a more comprehensive picture of the impact of the "silver tsunami" on the company and help the manager make informed decisions about the workforce and mentorship programs.
